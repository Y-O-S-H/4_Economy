###Why are some things illegal?
Because economists have yet to identify a way to navigate what people feel is a moral/ethical issue, when in fact it is more one of not willing to believe that there are enough people in the world who want to rehabilitate and save people.
###How do we make them legal?
Create an effective and obviously profitable plan that favors the legalization of something.
